# Face-Mask-Detection---Project

Wearing face masks is pivotal in combating COVID-19 by curbing the transmission of respiratory droplets. It is Vital for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, masks serve as a barrier, mitigating the risk of virus spread. Beyond personal protection, wearing a mask fosters community well-being, particularly shielding vulnerable populations.

The project aims to identify whether individuals in images or video streams are wearing face masks or not. This can be used in various scenarios such as public spaces, workplaces, and more to ensure adherence to safety guidelines.
